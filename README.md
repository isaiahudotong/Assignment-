I use Selenium webdriver and xPath to scrape the webpage. 
However, Selenium was detected by the webpage as robot due to the xpath failure. 
I found this thread on gitHub discussing issue between firefox (geckodriver) and selenium.  
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/659
I suspect this is the cause of the "cannot find element exception" given the correct xpath.

Please leave comment if you'd like to share your approach to tackle this problem.
